# Descripton

In this repo you will find the answer to the designed tests. Code and textual response are along together.
Feel free to ask any questions related to this test.

# 1. What’s your proudest achievement? It can be a personal project or something you’ve worked on professionally. Just a short paragraph is fine, but I’d love to know why you’re proud of it.

I will say that I'm always proud of the software I did from scratch or that I have improved with a new feature from one of my older company. Simply because they are still in use right now, even years later. It also improved my vision on a project and how it can be affected. It was also gratifying to get good positive feedback by QA teams and locally based clients that 2 of my games, whom I was leading the projects, that are deeply embedded in Asiatic culture are respective of the local rules and complete a high standard of quality.

# 2. Tell me about a technical book or article you read recently, why you liked it, and why I should read it.

The last book I read was: 'Mastering Bitcoin: Programming the Open Blockchain'. This book helped me improve my vision of where we started in the blockchain world and how it's affecting current business. Also, There are multiple technological details on the blockchain which are interesting on how we can implement within this kind of technology. It's a deeper subject that requires to already have a base knowledge but it will help get to know the foundation of this technology and let an open mind on the possible improvements and how cryptographic innovation can help in higher level problems.

# 3. Tell me about something on visual effects that you really like, and why.

I really like the details and the own style of an effect, it can be more realistic or more like a cartoon or anything. Also, it's impressive to see how this changed between the years and how much it was improved. I find it fun to play with and see what we can do, there is no limit to what we can manifest. It can be really impressive and it's normal to see it as art.

# 4. Write some code, that will flatten an array of arbitrarily nested arrays of integers into a flat array of integers ...

In this exercise, test-all, flatten and validation python file was added. Both, flatten and validation are to be used as utils functions for a higher level of implementation.
They are both a pre-implementation that solve the current case but will need to have more functionalities for larger uses cases.

# 5. Write a class TempTracker ...

In this exercise, Tracker and TempTracker models were added. Tracker is the parent of TempTracker so we will e able to create different trackers with the mean function owned by the tracker type since it seems specific. Possible improvements could be made with a fabric pattern and extend capabilities.
